SQL Improvement Logic Test :

1) Theres duplication of code at the WHERE filter "OR RecQualifications.name LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
2) Reduce the use of `LIKE` for text filter as it requires huge amount of computing power thus effect query performance. We reduce it by using FULL-Text Searching which is much more faster and more 	 less repeating code
